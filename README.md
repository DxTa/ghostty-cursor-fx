# Cursor FX for Ghostty

Thirteen animated cursor effects for the [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) terminal, with
two special moments: **Enter**, when you send a prompt in Claude Code or pi (or run a
command in zsh), the effect plays out from the cursor along the lines of the input
box; and **done**, when the answer arrives (or a long command finishes), it
plays again from the edges inward, so you notice even when you've looked away.
Switch effects with one command, tune them in a browser panel with a live preview.

Every cursor look stays one character wide, only touches the block itself (a letter
under the cursor stays readable) and holds still with `cursor-fx idle off`. The
prompt mark (the `❯` at the start of Claude Code's input line or your shell
prompt) takes the same style. The input box's two lines can have a calm look of
their own too (neon tubes, a lightning spark running across, a fireworks fuse, data
dashes for cyber…), off by default, and take a little of the effect's color
(`LINE_TINT` / `LINE_COLOR`, a plain tint, no glow). Every part of every effect has its
own on/off switch: typing, Enter, done, delete-all, the cursor's look, the prompt mark,
the box lines' color and their animated look (and blinking, off by default).

Moving forward along the row counts as typing: a letter, a Chinese character, or a
whole phrase your input method commits at once (it plays like one keystroke, never the
delete-all move; cyber and hologram decrypt or print the whole phrase). Each effect's
"Chinese input" switch turns that off. The prompt mark keeps its style when your prompt
wraps onto more rows and while Ghostty isn't the focused window (it holds still then). Deleting a whole line (select all + delete, Home) plays
each effect's big move; cursor jumps to another row stay quiet, so programs
redrawing the screen never set anything off.

## Known limitations

- **The input box is found by its look.** A shader can't ask Claude Code where its input box is,
  so each effect looks for a thin line across the window (ink at 5, 45, 66, 88 and 95 % of the
  width, background 4 px above and below) up to a few rows above and below the cursor. Claude
  Code draws it in grey (rgb 136 or 138), or in your palette's white with its ANSI themes. If
  that line is within about 3 % of your background color, or a Claude Code update redraws the
  box (lines 8 px or thicker, a sidebar, no lines), Enter plays just under the sent line
  instead. A full-width horizontal rule from another program right above or below the cursor
  lights up like a box line. Checked in the test harness with Claude Code's line grey on dark
  grey, black, Dracula and Solarized Dark backgrounds.
- **A prompt that wraps over several rows**: aurora, cyber, embers, fireworks, hologram, mecha and
  teleport play their Enter effect along the bottom box line only (glitch, katana,
  lightning, neon, phosphor and shockwave find both lines).
- **Forward jumps count as typing**: End, or accepting a shell suggestion, plays the small typing
  effect, not the big move (so committed Chinese text never sets off the delete-all move).
- **Other programs that set the cursor color** themselves (OSC 12) with an odd blue or green value
  can set off an Enter or done effect; the signals use those lowest bits.
- **tmux**: the Enter and done signals rely on the cursor color reaching Ghostty; inside tmux that
  depends on your tmux setup and is untested.
- **pi** needs "Show hardware cursor" on. Without it Ghostty sees no cursor: no cursor look,
  typing or done effects, and Enter plays where the cursor was last seen. The pi signals are
  checked with pi 1.4.0; the effects in pi are not yet checked in Ghostty.
- **bash and fish**: only the zsh hook ships; the README's snippets for other shells are untested.
- **Battery**: while any animated effect is on, Ghostty redraws the focused window continuously.
  `cursor-fx idle off` makes the screen calmer; `cursor-fx off` is the only real saver.

## Requirements

- Ghostty 1.4 or newer on **macOS or Linux** (Ghostty has no Windows build).
- Python 3.8 or newer (for `cursor-fx`; no packages needed; the one that comes with macOS works).
- A dark theme: the effects add light, so on a light background they are faint. Colors sit in the
  7–9.5:1 contrast range on a dark grey background.
- A block cursor (Ghostty's default). With a bar or underline cursor (for example vim's insert mode)
  the cursor, prompt-mark and box-line looks stay off; the moves and Enter effects still play.

## Install

Clone this repository (or download it as a ZIP from the green **Code** button), then in its folder:

```sh
./install.sh
```

This copies `shaders/` and `cursor-effects/` next to your Ghostty config (found in Ghostty's
config folder or its macOS folder; symlinks are followed), `cursor-fx` into `~/.local/bin`, and
the pi extension into `~/.pi/agent` when that folder exists. It backs up anything it replaces. Then:

```sh
cursor-fx lightning    # pick an effect; Ghostty reloads at once
cursor-fx              # list them, the active one marked
cursor-fx off          # plain cursor
```

Copying a single shader by hand instead? On **Linux**, change `#define Y_DOWN true`
near its top to `false`, or the effect plays upside down (`install.sh` does this for you).

### The Enter and done effects

Shaders can't see keys, so two tiny hooks tell the effect what happened: `cursor-fx
signal` on Enter and `cursor-fx signal done` when the answer arrives. Each nudges
the cursor color by one invisible step for a moment (the last bit of the blue or
green value); the shader reads that as the signal.

**Claude Code** — merge `hooks/claude-code-hook.json` into `~/.claude/settings.json`:
a `UserPromptSubmit` hook for Enter and a `Stop` hook (Claude finished answering)
for done.

**pi** — `install.sh` copies `hooks/pi-extension.ts` to `~/.pi/agent/extensions/cursor-fx.ts`
and sets **Show hardware cursor** (`showHardwareCursor` in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`), which
the effects need because pi hides the terminal cursor by default. Run `/reload` in pi. Enter
fires when you send a prompt; done fires when pi has finished and won't continue on its own.

**zsh** — add `hooks/zsh-hook.zsh` to your `~/.zshrc`: Enter before every command,
done after any command that took more than 5 seconds. (bash/fish: call
`cursor-fx signal --tty "$(tty)"` from your pre-command hook and `cursor-fx signal
done --tty "$(tty)"` after long commands.)

Switch them off any time with `cursor-fx enter off`; `cursor-fx jumps off` silences
the delete-all moves; `cursor-fx idle off` stops the small animations between
keystrokes (crackle, breath, ping) for a calmer screen.

## Battery

Be aware: while any animated shader is installed, Ghostty redraws the focused
window on every screen refresh (that's how time-based effects work), and that
redraw is the real power cost, not the effects themselves. The shaders return
early for pixels they don't touch, and windows in the background never animate
(Ghostty's default). `cursor-fx idle off` makes the screen calmer but saves
little; the only real saving on battery is `cursor-fx off`, which removes the
shader so Ghostty redraws only when something changes.

## Tune it

```sh
cursor-fx edit
```

opens a local page. The preview (the real shader) stays on screen while you adjust
the settings next to it: just type to try the effect, no click needed (Chinese and other input methods work too; Enter sends, ⌘⌫ deletes
the line), or use its buttons for Enter, done and delete-all; zoom in on the cursor
(2×, 4×) and slow it down (½×, ¼×) to see the details. Every effect's settings come
in the same sections, in the same order: Typing, Enter & done, Delete-all, Cursor,
Prompt mark ❯, Input box lines, Look and Timing. A section's on/off switch sits in its
title (the section dims when it's off), the settings worth a tweak sit under it, and
the rest fold under "More settings" in the same section. Every change is written to
the shader file and Ghostty reloads; the status pill says "Saved … · Ghostty
reloaded", changed rows show their old value with a one-click reset, and the first
change of a session makes a backup you can roll back with one command. The cursor's
color and "Cursor blinks" are in the Cursor section, for that effect alone. The
switches at the top (Enter & done, delete-all, idle animations) set every effect at
once (half-filled when effects differ). The
page is in Chinese when your system's language is Chinese and in English
otherwise; the button at the top switches between them (remembered by the browser).

## How it works

- Each effect is a Ghostty `custom-shader` (`shaders/*.glsl`) plus a preset
  (`cursor-effects/<name>.conf`) that sets the cursor color (and, if it wants, its own
  `cursor-style-blink`, which overrides your config's) and points at the shader.
  `cursor-fx <name>` writes one `config-file = cursor-effects/<name>.conf` line into
  your Ghostty config and reloads Ghostty (SIGUSR2).
- Settings are the `const` lines at the top of each shader; the panel edits those lines.
- The Enter signal is the lowest bit of the cursor color's blue value, so every
  preset color keeps that value even.
- The input box lines are found by looking for a thin line across the width just
  above and below the cursor (see Known limitations); in a plain shell the Enter
  effect plays under the line you sent.
- Ghostty gives shaders y-down pixels on macOS and y-up pixels on Linux. Each shader
  is written y-up and has a `#define Y_DOWN` switch (with `screenAt()` and
  `upCursor()`) that `install.sh` sets for your system, so effects that rise do
  rise on both.

## Add an effect

Drop a shader into `shaders/` and a preset into `cursor-effects/`:

```
# Name: one-line description shown by `cursor-fx`
cursor-color = #9fd0fe
custom-shader = ../shaders/name-cursor.glsl
```

It shows up in `cursor-fx` and the panel automatically. Keep the shader's
settings as `const` lines under a `// --- settings` comment, with the rarely
needed ones after `// --- fine-tuning ---`. A `// -- Name` line starts a section;
use the shared ones (`Typing`, `Enter & done`, `Delete-all`, `Cursor`, `Prompt mark`,
`Box lines`, `Look`, `Timing`) and the shared switches (`TYPE_EFFECT`, `PHRASE_EFFECT`, `ENTER_EFFECT`,
`DONE_EFFECT`, `JUMP_EFFECTS`, `CURSOR_EFFECT`, `PROMPT_EFFECT`, `LINE_TINT`,
`LINE_EFFECT`, `IDLE_EFFECTS`) so the panel lays it out like the others. Write each
note so it reads on its own. An `int` whose note ends in `: 0 one, 1 two, 2 three`
shows as named buttons. Copy the `Y_DOWN` block from an
existing shader, read the screen through `screenAt()` and the cursors through
`upCursor()`.

## Uninstall

`cursor-fx off`, then remove `shaders/`, `cursor-effects/` and the
`config-file = cursor-effects/...` line from your Ghostty config, and the hooks.

## Development

`test/index.html` is a WebGL harness that runs a shader over a drawn terminal
screen with Ghostty's uniforms: run `python3 -m http.server` in this folder and
open `http://localhost:8000/test/index.html?shader=../shaders/lightning-cursor.glsl&color=9fd0fe`; `tests.js`,
`tests2.js` and `tests3.js` hold the checks used while building the effects.
`sync-from-ghostty.sh` copies your live, tuned files back into this folder.
`promo/` renders the promo video and the pictures in this README from the same shaders
(see `promo/README.md`).
